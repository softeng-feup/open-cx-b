## Product Vision
Often, networking at a conference is a messy and arduous affair. The standard
of business card trading has lost its touch with modern realities, being
cumbersome, expensive and unfriendly to the environment. However, they
represented a solution to the circumstances at hand. They are:

 * Easy to exchange and store
 * Compact and straight to the point
 * A medium to showcase appealing design

What if you could bridge these advantages and modern technologies to have your
cake and eat it too? *Cardy B* aims to do just that.

It is an innovative digital networking system, using the latest in interactive
technologies to provide seamless, paperless networking to the participants of
your conference. With this system in place, your users can:

 * Create their virtual business card, integrated with their social media, CVs,
 or portfolios
 * Have a wallet to store their connections right on their phones/conference
 app/website
 * Exchange information in an intuitive, seamless and convenient way
 * Interacting with smart badges and sponsor stands, making use of the latest
 in NFC and QR technologies
 * Look cool while doing all of it

We understand that sometimes there is an option between interaction and
convenience, but with *Cardy B* you can get them both, you don't need to
choose.

No plan B needed.

## Elevator Pitch
Have you recently been to a conference? How many business cards did you collect?

If I had to hazard a guess, it was a pain in the ass to  store them all, and to follow up on them.

Our new system, Cardy B, is going to solve just that. Just pull out your
smartphone and scan their badge, and you'll get their cards just like that.

\*snap fingers\*

You can also get your card out as a sponsor or speaker and have custom
styling. Want an adventure? Contact us for info.

## Requirements
